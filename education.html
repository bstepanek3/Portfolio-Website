		<p> I am currently in my third year at Georgia Tech where I study Computational Media. Essentially, over the course of my time at Tech I have gained many valuable techincal and creative skills. I use these skills to dabble in design (check out my <a href="experiences.html">illustrations!</a>) and create a few projects that will -by the end of semester- be the basis of my own video game. <br>
		Below is just a sample of some of the skills I have accquired over the past 3 years. </p>
