	<h1> So who exactly is Brooke Stepanek? </h1>
	<div class = "stuff">
		<p> I am a third year Computational Media student at Georgia Tech. <br>
		<br>
		My major is basically a fancy way of saying that I can code <b> and </b> make it aesthetically pleasing. <br>
		<br>
		I am taking two concentrations in game studies and media technologies <br><br>
		My goal is to be a video game designer. <br><br>
		My goal is to also be an animator. <br><br>
		Another goal is to find ways to make technology an entertaining educational platform. <br><br>
		You could say I have a lot of goals. <br><br>
		You could say that I also have a lot of ambition. <br><br>
		Both of these would be true. <br> <br>
